Hey! I’m Alex Hope, I am currently a masters student in data science at UBC who is in love with computers and learning. Previously I had worked in mental health research, studying the effects of different interventions on anxiety and mood disorders. As I begin to explore the depths of modern computing and learn new approaches to analysis, machine learning, and visualization, I can’t help but be excited about what the future holds.

Now that I live in Vancouver you’ll either find me stuffing my face with sushi, hanging out at the beach or working in front of a computer in the most comfortable coffee shop I can find. Which is currently JJ Bean…. I also play hockey and golf when I can and have an active meditation practice that keeps me grounded on what I value most in this life.
