Hey! This is my first blog post and as such it deserves an introduction. My name is Alex, and I'm an aspiring data scientist who studied biology and mental health for the last 6 years before setting his sights on computer science. There's a lot for me to explore in this field and I can't wait to begin learning, growing, and applying the exciting skills in my masters at UBC to new fields.
