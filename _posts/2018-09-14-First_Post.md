Hey! This is my first blog post and as such it deserves an introduction. My name is Alex, and I'm an aspiring data scientist who studied biology and mental health for the last 6 years before setting his sights on computer science. There's a lot for me to explore in this field and I can't wait to begin learning, growing, and applying the exciting skills in my masters at UBC to new fields.

The majority of my time in clinical research has been spent trying to clarify diagnostic and treatment factors related to clinical depression and a range of anxeity disorders. This has led to investigations of brain processes, where I examined the construct of emotion regulation and the brain processes that support it in both healthy and clinical populations, as well as the role of patient outcome expectancies and therapeutic credibility in actual treatment outcomes in major depression.
